made following this video >>> https://youtu.be/gYRrGTC7GtA <<<

todo list:
collisions
textures
HP?+Ammo? enemies?????????
maybe just make wolfenstein 3D
better controls 
billbroard

finished thingalings:
2D map

problem list:
grid size is locked to 64 (honestly whatever)
should prolly put all of the raycast code in a func and call that twice instead of just having the code twice :/
player speed and wall height is locked to map size, so if the map is bigger it's also smaller?? a

(fixed) problem list:
visual glitches at certain distances when both shadows and distance fading are turned on
distance fading only works with shades of gray
one of the walls is showing up as not that??????
it just doesn't work. why? has I ever?
